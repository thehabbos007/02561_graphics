    <p>
      a) What is the difference between Phong shading and Phong lighting (the
      Phong reflection model)?
      <b
        >The Phong reflection model speicifes for a given point, how much light
        is directed towards an observer through Diffuse, Specular and Ambient
        terms.</b
      >
      <b
        >Phong shading refers to the approximation of the of the shading of a
        surface through linear interpolation.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      b) What is the difference between flat shading, Gouraud shading, and Phong
      shading? List pros and cons of each. Is Gouraud or Phong shading the best
      method for simulating highlights? Explain.
      <b
        >Phong shading is the "best" method for simulating highlights. Gouraud
        shading misses information about the highlights at vertices, which makes
        highlihgts disappear from the polygon</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      c) What is the difference between a directional light and a point light?
      <b
        >Directional lights are infinitely far away, which means that the right
        rays are considered parallel when they hit objects that should be
        illuminated. Point lights have a position relavitve to objects and
        dictate illumination by distance.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      d) Does the eye position influence the shading of an object in any way?
      <b
        >Yes eye position does influence shading, as we calculate light rays
        compared to the eye posiiton</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      e) What is the effect of setting the specular term to (0, 0, 0)?
      <b>The specular light disappears from the illumination</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      f) What is the effect of increasing the shininess exponent (ùõº)?
      <b
        >The specular highlight is reduced. The surface is mirror-like and
        smoother.</b
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      g) In what coordinate space did you compute the lighting?<b
        >In eye-space</b
      >
