      Projection shadows are easy to implement, as it is possible to do so
      within the same WebGL program, but the cons of using this method is
      visible from the results. The shadow is somewhat flickery and can error
      prone when it comes to culling. Shadow mapping, while more complicated,
      yield better results. The shadow doesn't flicker, and the depth packing
      technique allows for shadow edges on par with projection shadows. Shadow
      mapping would also allow to have self-shadowing.
